# PhotoScraper

Facebook Access Token -- To run the code, go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools-and-support/ and click on Graph API Explorer to get an access token. You'll need to ask for access to photos. Put this string into a file called API_KEYS.txt. I've included this file in my gitignore because I didn't want to post my person API key to github.
